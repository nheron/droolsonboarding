# Intended audience 
This book, as its title suggests, is for newcomers to drools. As explained in the drools tutorial, when using drools you will change the classical development paradigm you are using, going from procedural to declarative programming. The shift is not complex to accomplish, but there is a need for an onboarding set of tutorials that will help you to jump into implementing algorithm/business rules with drools with no difficulty. 
As a regular trainer of drools, I can only encourage you to do the exercises completely by yourself and try not to go the solutions directly. 
By doing so, the learning curve will be a little longer but so much easier at the end. By going directly to the solution, you will miss 50% of the training content.
