# Overview




Software programmers are used to a procedural approach when it comes to implementing Business requirements. The consequence is that the business rule implementation solely depends on the competence and understanding the software developer has of the Business Rules he has to implement.
This limitation was already seen and identified by researchers. Object oriented programming may be seen as "the solution" to business implementation and agility and many developers rely on this paradigm. At the end, the Object oriented approach ends up with the classic ["Spaghetti code"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code).
To avoid this ending, a new approach was taken called "[declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)".
This is a big shift and we shall try to focus on that before learning the tooling around drools.
- The first set of tutorials, called "drools tutorials", start from the base concepts (there are few and is concentrated on the the core engine) up to more language concepts.
- The second set of tutorials, called  "BRMS tutorials", will introduce the the management tooling (called workbench)  around the lifecycle of the rule artifact. But the workbench also introduces more artifact types like decision table, rule templates, etc.. That will help when modeling business requirements.
- The third set of tutorials, called "BRMS runtime tutorials", start to introduce possible software architectures in a real project. In the examples parts, we will use ideas that we describe in that part.
